## Introduction to IPFS

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is - 
* Open source project :heavy_check_mark: 
* Protocol :heavy_check_mark: 
* Network :heavy_check_mark:
* Peer-to-peer distributed file system :heavy_check_mark:
* Modular :heavy_check_mark:
* encrypted :heavy_check_mark:

and so on !! 

Take a deep dive [here](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) !! 

In short, it is Git like version control system which works like BitTorrent and provides security like bitcoin !!!! Wow !!! 
There is more though, it can work as web and even has its own name service called IPNS .... 

## Why would we use it ?

To make web faster, safer and more open. but how ? 

Look at this [Stanford Seminar - IPFS and the Permanent Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI)

Or just look here - ![The web](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNhFJjGcMPqpuYfxL62VVB9528NXqDNMFXiqN5bgFYiZ1/images/centralized-decentralized-distributed.jpg "IPFS")

* Centralized 
   - One place stores everything and everyone access the files from this place ! 
   - (Imagine One StarBucks :coffee: in town and Everyone wants :coffee: !)
   - I won't get coffee soon :(
* Decentralized 
   - One place stores everything and everyone access the files from this place ! 
   - (Imagine Main StarBucks :coffee: in town and Everyone wants :coffee: !)  
   - I will get coffee in sometime :|
* Distributed
   - One place stores everything and everyone access the files from this place ! 
   - (Imagine Everyone can sell StarBucks :coffee: and Everyone wants :coffee: !)
   - I will get coffee right away :D
   
### Okay !! I think you can figure out things now and will proceed to some hands on --
